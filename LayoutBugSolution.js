The provided solution uses `useLayoutEffect` instead of `useEffect` and ensures that state updates are triggered only after the component has finished rendering.  This approach leverages the fact that `useLayoutEffect` runs synchronously after all DOM mutations and ensures that the layout is complete before we access or react to the `layout` object.  This prevents the race conditions that can occur with `useEffect` and asynchronous operations.  Additionally, error handling is implemented to prevent crashes in cases where `layout` is null or undefined.
