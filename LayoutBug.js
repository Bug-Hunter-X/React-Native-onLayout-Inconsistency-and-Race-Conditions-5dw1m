This error occurs when you use a component that doesn't correctly handle the `onLayout` event or when there's a race condition between layout measurements and state updates.  The `onLayout` event provides dimensions of a component after it has been rendered and measured.  If you attempt to access these dimensions before the layout has completed, you'll encounter this problem.  Additionally, if you update state based on layout dimensions, but the state update triggers a re-render before the layout is complete, you'll get stuck in an infinite loop.
